<p>On the 2022 winter holidays I took a day off to buy some fir from Machot. I had watched Paul Sellers&#39;s workbench videos 3 or 4 times (<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqyeNiM0BJuWNDgY1FpyxjveO2Y90CvD9&amp;si=DWqILtjq4mGR5w99" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqy</span><span class="invisible">eNiM0BJuWNDgY1FpyxjveO2Y90CvD9&amp;si=DWqILtjq4mGR5w99</span></a>, 5 h long), I had an empty house with a spacious workshop, a few basic tools, some confidence after having built a low workbench the previous Christmas, and it was time to build something great. I had no idea how long it would take but t felt like the start of a long journey.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/eefc28a67f1c5431.jpg)
<p>I planed some 2x4s, got some more clamps from Castorama  (<a href="https://youtu.be/7zQanPvnr9o?si=-SVY1rRzcZ0fH2at" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">youtu.be/7zQanPvnr9o?si=-SVY1r</span><span class="invisible">RzcZ0fH2at</span></a>), and glued them up. That was my bench top, on the 15th of February. Once dry I set it up on trestles to build the rest of the bench.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/ae6c6291a70d972d.jpg)
<p>Then we moved in, and on the first of April Polpetta was three months and 5 days old.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/d320cf017e3a87e6.jpg)
<p>On Sunday, the 10th of April, I had glued and flattened the two aprons, which look like the top but are thinner.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/f2007fb7d5edae81.jpg)
<p>On the night of Tuesday April 12th, I started digging my first mortise with a chisel, as Paul Sellers taught me (<a href="https://youtu.be/q_NXq7_TILA?si=GQEiPMaHSRl_bE_W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">youtu.be/q_NXq7_TILA?si=GQEiPM</span><span class="invisible">aHSRl_bE_W</span></a>). One week later my four feet were ready.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/312e46ad3d75f804.jpg)
<p>The legs are joined in pairs, by rails that go into the mortises. So I proceeded  with cutting the rails, and their tenons. And it stood square in the spring sun, on a Friday afternoon.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/424e97a6d42c8a8d.jpg)
<p>A board is glued and screwed on each leg pair. The legs are inserted into trapezoidal dadoes in the aprons. A wedge keeps the aprons in place, along with four big bolts that go through the legs. On a Saturday evening, by nine o&#39;clock, my bench was starting to look like one.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/c8746d8a5523f274.jpg)
<p>This story got interrupted midway, but I am now back in a train speeding through Burgundy. Naked hedges outline green brown fields in the dark light of January. Here is a picture of some things that make me happy. You can see the bolts holding the aprons, a bright and bold kid who speaks many languages, a sculpture by my grandfather Jean Touret, a painting my my cousin Emmanuel Lafitte, a breton calendar, a stopped great-grandfather clock, and a workbench where previously there was nothing.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/04bb411c6f858ff0.jpg)
<p>This workbench has a recessed area all along the working surface, that is great for storing tools without them risking to fall on the floor. The bottom of this area is a board with tongues on the sides, that slide into grooves plowed into the bench top, and the apron. Tongues and grooves are best done with special planes, but at this point I did not possess these. So I built a rebate plane (for the tongue) and a plough plane (for the grooves), out of fir, where my chisels are used as blades.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/289ad9ace465f4c3.jpg)
<p>The grooves and tongues were done around midnight on a Wednesday. I took the next Friday off to ride along the cm2 classes to La Taillat ; kids would play the game where they say something unintelligible, I ask &quot;quoi ?&quot;, and they reply &quot;quoicoubeh&quot; (kids are awesome).</p><p>In the afternoon I glued and screwed the bench top to the apron and feet. I could not stop, so I started fitting the vise, and went to bed around 2:30 in the morning after admiring my bench silently for a long time. The vise was heavy and I remember fearing that I would damage it or hurt myself if I continued working so tired.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/9534214f7c4bd89d.jpg)
<p>On Saturday, May 7th I planed the bench top, making sure it is straight and untwisted while my youngest kid was celebrating his 8th birthday in the garden with his friends. Is it a good idea to do that after fitting the vise ? Haha, probably no.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/295c528c91058a73.jpg)
<p>And so on the eighth of May 2022, I installed ash jaws on the vise, and decided that I was done. We could finally start working. The end.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/78dbe34880dff616.jpg)
